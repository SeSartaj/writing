# Writing is Hard? random

Asalam Alaykom dear readers. I'm grad to God that he has given me the fingers to write and the eyes to read. Writing is a mean of communication which differentiates Humans from other animals. by this mean we can preserve and transmit our knowledge. 

I have a huge problem with my memory, and without memory one can't become a good writer. I will make plenty of Duas to God the almighty to improve my memory.

Today I have searched about the islamic ways and methods for improving memory. here I'm sharing it for your benefit: 

1. Making Dua: Dr. Zakir Naik, a famous muslim preacher with exceptional memory, is said to frequently recite ayah 25-28 of Surah Taha. 
2. Keep away from Sins
3. Using Miswak 
4. chewing raisin: it is beleived that raisin improves memory.
5.
